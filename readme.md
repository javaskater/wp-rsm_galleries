* this plugin is meant to display your post images in a dynamic and responsive way using [lighbox.js](http://osvaldas.info/image-lightbox-responsive-touch-friendly) library
* It is also meant to display standard Wordpress Galleries in the way the [Jquery Light Gallery Plugin](http://sachinchoolur.github.io/lightGallery/) makes it, the thumbss on their side are organised by the Jquery Masonry plugin, an example of it is drawn out of our [stay in Burgundy in 2015](http://rsmontreuil.fr/rando-bourgogne/)
   * I recently added the possibility to display a public Picasa Gallery this way (instead off just a simple link), an example of it is drawn out of our [first inline skating hike from Paris to London July 2015](http://rsmontreuil.fr/le-paris-londres-cest-parti/)
      * That meant adding a Picasa media button at the top of Wordpress Editor
   * Previous Joomla Galleries are also displayed the same Way, an example of it is drawn out of our [stay in Burgundy in 2014](http://rsmontreuil.fr/bourgogne-le-cru-2014/)
