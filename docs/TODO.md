## Single image from social networks:

* The case of [the expedition of the local skating comite to the marathon of Dijon](http://rollersports93.fr/semi-et-marathon-de-dijon/) shows I notices that I can use a Google Photo URL (Wordpress Kernel) as source for the media
  * in the case the album has been shared through a link!
  * All features of the js libraries are not available !
* I want to test it with public pictures of FaceBook pages like thoses of the [In line skating Montreuil's Derby Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/RSMontreuilDerby/)
